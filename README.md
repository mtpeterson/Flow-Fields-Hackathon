# Flow Fields - Hackathon Project
This is a simulation of flow fields realized in Processing(Java) under a 4-hour time constraint

Much of this project was adapting this to work in Processing, along with some fun individual exploration of vector and flow fields.

The entire project, along with pictures and videos, can be found on my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/185467187/Flow-Fields-Hackathon-Project).
